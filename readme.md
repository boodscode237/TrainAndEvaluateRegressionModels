<h1 align="center">What is regression?</h1>

<p><em>Regression</em> works by establishing a relationship between <em>variables</em>
in the data that represent characteristics—known as the <em>features</em>—of the thing being observed, and the variable 
we're trying to predict—known as the label.</p>

<p>The use of historic data with known label values to train a model makes regression an example of supervised machine learning.</p>

# Regression

*Supervised* machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of *features* and predict a *label* using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. The training process *fits* the features to the known labels to define a general function that can be applied to new features for which the labels are unknown, and predict them. You can think of this function like this, in which ***y*** represents the label we want to predict and ***x*** represents the features the model uses to predict it.

    y = f(x)

In most cases, *x* is actually a *vector* that consists of multiple feature values, so to be a little more precise, the function could be expressed like this:

    y = f([x_1, x_2, x_3, ...])

The goal of training the model is to find a function that performs some kind of calculation to the *x* values that produces the result *y*. We do this by applying a machine learning *algorithm* that tries to fit the *x* values to a calculation that produces *y* reasonably accurately for all of the cases in the training dataset.

There are lots of machine learning algorithms for supervised learning, and they can be broadly divided into two types:

- **_Regression_ algorithms**: Algorithms that predict a *y* value that is a numeric value, such as the price of a house or the number of sales transactions.
- **_Classification_ algorithms**: Algorithms that predict to which category, or *class*, an observation belongs. The *y* value in a classification model is a vector of probability values between 0 and 1, one for each class, indicating the probability of the observation belonging to each class.
